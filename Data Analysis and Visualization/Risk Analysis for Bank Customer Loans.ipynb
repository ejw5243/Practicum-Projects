    "Looking at the `income_type` for the 'jobless' customers, it is expected that most would be unemployed or retirees, which is not the case. Although there are several retirees, there are also civil servants, business owners, and regular employees listed. There are a few potential reasons this may be the case:\n",
    "- The initial assumption that these were jobless people was incorrect and there was some other error with gathering the data that resulted in missing values.\n",
    "- Some of the customers are volunteers that do not have an income.\n",
    "- Customers who are unemployed refrained from actually stating they are unemployed for fear of immediately being turned down for a loan.\n",

    "\n",
    "Regardless of the reason for the missing values, these attribute values will remain a '0' value for these customers as it seems like an appropriate replacement without knowing the customers true `total_income`. Although these missing values make up a fair amount of the overall number of data entries (~10%), a customer's total income is only one of the attributing factors for determining whether the customer will default on a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach to replacing the missing values could have been to replace the missing values with the mean or median of the other customer's data. This may have misrepresented the customer's with average incomes if the customer with missing value `total_income` had a higher likelihood of defaulting on a loan. The exact impact of doing this could be quantified; however, the benefit is not worth the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data type replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the attributes in the data set, `days_employed` and `total_income`, are of the float data type. It is much cleaner to make these values an integer data type, seeing as there is limited benefit in knowing the fraction of days in `days_employed` or the number of cents in a customer's `total_income`.

    "\n",

However, housing and real estate is known to retain value, so even if a customer fails to meet the payments on the loan, the housing or real estate could be sold without much loss to repay the loan. A car, on the other hand, is notorious for depreciating quickly, which would be detrimental for a customer who is unable to make the loan payments. Likewise, for student loans, unless the recent graduate gets a well-paying job right out of college, the high cost of a university degree is often difficult to pay back. Weddings fall into the middle range likely because they are not quite as expensive as education, but do not hold any value to offset the cost of the loan.\n",

    "To determine the correlation between specific customer attributes and the ability to pay back a loan, various pivot tables highlighting the bank's existing customer credit worthiness data were utilized to determine the overall percentage of customers that defaulted on loans with respect to the various attributes considered: children, marital status, income level, and loan purpose.

    "From the data that was generated, there is not one clear attribute that signifies a customer will or will not default on a loan. Rather, certain situations in each of the attributes slightly increase the chance that a customer will default on a loan. While it is shown that customer's that have children or are unmarried or in a civil partnership have the highest likelihood for defaulting on a loan, the other attributes must also be taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a customer may be in a civil partnership and have kids, but fall under the wealth income bracket and are using the loan to fund a new house. The overall risk of this customer defaulting on a loan would fall into a medium risk area as the low risk of being in the wealthy income bracket and using the loan for housing would offset the risk associated with children and being in a civil partnership.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these attributes must be carefully evaluated for prospective customers. Risk must not be scored on one individual attribute, but all attributes. Customer's who fall into the riskier categories for all four of the attributes evaluated herein should be considered a risky customer from the bank's perspective."
