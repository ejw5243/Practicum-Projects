For example, customers who are retirees must also provide the number of children they have; however, a majority of their children would likely no longer be living with the retiree and would have their own job and source of income. These children would, in most cases, not be financially supported by the customer and would have minimal effect on whether the customer defaults on a loan or not. Additional investigation into the data would be required to fully quantify this; however, the benefit is not worth the time seeing as the number of children is only one piece of the puzzle for determining if a customer will default on a loan.

For example, an unmarried customer has only one source of income to repay a loan whereas a married customer could have two sources of income that can be utilized to repay the loan. The civil partnership likelihood is interesting in that one would think this would be closer to the likelihood for married customers, but it is significantly higher.

    "Initially it was assumed that housing loans would result in the highest chance of defaulting, simply because the amount of these loans are significantly higher compared to the other categories. However, housing and real estate is known to retain value, so even if a customer fails to meet the payments on the loan, the housing or real estate could be sold without much loss to repay the loan. A car, on the other hand, is notorious for depreciating quickly, which would be detrimental for a customer who is unable to make the loan payments. Likewise, for student loans, unless the recent graduate gets a well-paying job right out of college, the high cost of a university degree is often difficult to pay back. Weddings fall into the middle range likely because they are not quite as expensive as education, but do not hold any value to offset the cost of the loan."

    "From the data that was generated, there is not one clear attribute that signifies a customer will or will not default on a loan. Rather, certain situations in each of the attributes slightly increase the chance that a customer will default on a loan. While it is shown that customer's that have children or are unmarried or in a civil partnership have the highest likelihood for defaulting on a loan, the other attributes must also be taken into account. \n",

    "For example, a customer may be in a civil partnership and have kids, but fall under the wealth income bracket and are using the loan to fund a new house. The overall risk of this customer defaulting on a loan would fall into a medium risk area as the low risk of being in the wealthy income bracket and using the loan for housing would offset the risk associated with children and being in a civil partnership.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these attributes must be carefully evaluated for prospective customers. Risk must not be scored on one individual attribute, but all attributes. Customer's who fall into the riskier categories for all four of the attributes evaluated herein should be considered a risky customer from the bank's perspective. "
