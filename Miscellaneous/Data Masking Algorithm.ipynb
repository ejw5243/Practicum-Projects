Since P does not affect the linear regression model's predictions or quality as shown in the proof above, this allows for the dataset features to be inconsequential masked. This will be shown using the actual dataset in the upcoming section.\n",

    "Next an algorithm was proposed that described the process for masking the dataset and evaluating the model quality. The algorithm was subsequently tested on models for both the original, unmasked dataset, and the transformed, masked dataset. The R2 score for each of these models were nearly identical, validating the proof. The proposed algorithm is successful at transforming the data to protect personal information."
