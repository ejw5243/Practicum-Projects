# Practicum-Projects
A collection of all the data analysis / data science projects completed during the Yandex Practicum professional training program. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

## Contents

* **Data Analysis and Visualization**
  * [Risk Analysis for Bank Customer Loans](https://github.com/ejw5243/Practicum-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization/Risk%20Analysis%20for%20Bank%20Customer%20Loans.ipynb): Analysis of the leading factors that cause bank customers to default on loans and which result in the greatest risk.
  * [Vehicle Price - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/ejw5243/Practicum-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization/Vehicle%20Price%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploraratory analysis of a vehicle's price based on various information available from online vehicle advertisements. Data visualization performed using Pandas and Seaborn.
  * [Phone Plan Profitability Analysis](https://github.com/ejw5243/Practicum-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization/Phone%20Plan%20Profitability%20Analysis.ipynb): Analysis of the potential profitability of two new mobile phone plans based on existing customer data.
  * Analysis of Successful Video Games: Analysis of the factors that help a video game succeed financially based on years of historical data.

* **Machine Learning**
  * [Customer Phone Plan Recommendation](https://github.com/ejw5243/Practicum-Projects/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Customer%20Phone%20Plan%20Recommendation%20Model.ipynb): A model that predicts which phone plan a customer will select based on monthly minute, message, and data usage. The model recommends the best plan for future customer's.
  * Supervised Learning: Prediction of Customer Turnover: Predicts whether a customer will leave his or her current contract. Evaluates the effect of class imbalance and utilizes upsampling to address the class imbalance.
  * Oil Well Regional Case Study: Using oil well production data from various regions, a model is created to predict the most profitable locations for future oil wells. Bootstrapping is used to statistically predict the profit ranges to evaluate the risk associated with the most profitable locations.
  * Gold Extraction Prediction Model: Predicts the success of gold extraction from gold ore based on known parameters in the cleaning process. 

* **Miscellaneous**
  * Data Masking Algorithm: Proposes and validates a data masking technique to protect customer personal information.
